Custom Suit Loader

Enables custom suits to be used without replacing existing suits (Works both Online and with Peacock). Requires the SMF and the ModSDK.
Also (optionally) allows for the Season 3 default starting suits to be used across any map in the game.

Known issues:
- Suits mods need to be specifically built to work with this mod (Suit Creators: See the optional download for an example)
- Enabling suit images online requires an optional setting in SMF, but this will potentially cause minor bugs that IO have already fixed previously
- The selected suit may not save between playthroughs, leaving it blank or reset to default
- You can't add DLC suits with this, to prevent piracy
